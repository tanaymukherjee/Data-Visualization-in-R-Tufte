# Data-Visualization-in-r-Tufte-
The idea behind Tufte in R is to use R - the most powerful open-source statistical programming language - to replicate excellent visualization practices developed by Edward Tufte.

There are plenty of excellent R functions and related packages wrote by people who have much more expertise in programming than myself. I simply collect those resources in one place in an accessible and replicable format, adding a few bits of my own coding discoveries.


Credit: I found this wonderful article - http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/ by Lukasz Piwek who has used Tufte's method to come up with some really cool and visually appealing charts. The ones which we have done earlier through known packages, but this exercise gives a new way to appraoch the same like line charts, box plot, bar charts, etc.

Requirements
You need the most recent version of R installed on you computer. You also need a basic understanding of R and there are some great online tutorials to get you started. I also recommend R Studio as an integrated development environment for R.

I use resources from a number of R packages. You can install all those packages at once via R console using the command below:

install.packages(c("CarletonStats", "devtools", "epanetReader", "fmsb", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", 
                   "latticeExtra", "MASS", "PerformanceAnalytics", "psych", 
                   "plyr", "prettyR", "plotrix", "proto", "RCurl", "reshape", "reshape2"))
